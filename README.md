- Text
- ~~Video~~ _To be supported in future version_
>This is an important application especially in today's world.<br>
> We need hide the messages rather than only encrypting them.

### Stenography is not Cryptography ! :confused:
If you are getting confused between _Stenography_ & _Cryptography_. Then see this -
#### Cryptography 
**If** `you = wms` **then** `Qcaapgrw gq gknmprylr` **= ?**<br>
_Can you guess the answer?_<br>
Here we have `key = -2` i.e. if we go 2 alphabets behind `y` you get 
`w` and similarly if you go 2 alphabets behind `o` we get `m` and similarly 2 alphabets behind `u` gives us `s`. Therefore `you = wms`. <br>
So now you may have got the answer which is `Security is important`.
> Note: The cryptography algorithms are much advanced now.
#### Stenography
So now that you know what is cryptography so lets know what is _Stenography_.<br>
**If** `____=____` **then** `______=______` **?**<br>
_Confused ?_<br>
Here you won't be able to even sense the presence of data. Leave alone knowing what
is the data. That's why it is called hiding data in plain sight. There are some applications which
may detect the presence of hidden data. CIA obviously has it <emoji><br>
Generally at professional level the data hidden is encrypted first. So _stenography_ and _cryptography_ are not
mutually exclusive to each other.
